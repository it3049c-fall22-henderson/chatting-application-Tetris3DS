## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
20. I got the assignment to work in an orderly manner. I also appreciate the code given for this assignment. I feel much less lost, and I can use the provided code as an example of how I can properly use it, instead of feeling confused and searching the internet for a solution.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I prefer this kind of assignment to last weeks. It was confusing having to browse the internet for the correct answer if I failed a test last week. The provided code allowed for a simpler and clean way to impliment the chat system. Now when I use this code to make a game later I'll have this as a perfect example!

### How long it took me to finish this?
2 hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
It creates the fourth smallest text display for the text.
